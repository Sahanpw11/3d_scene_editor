## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sahanpw11/3d_scene_editor.git
cd 3d_scene_editor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash

## Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Adding Objects**: Use the toolbar to add cubes or spheres to the scene
2. **Selecting Objects**: Click on objects to select them, or use Ctrl+click for multi-selection
3. **Transforming Objects**: 
   - Press `G` for translate mode
   - Press `R` for rotate mode
   - Press `S` for scale mode
   - Use the precision input panel for exact values

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+K` | Open command palette |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Redo |
| `G` | Translate mode |
| `R` | Rotate mode |
| `S` | Scale mode |
| `Delete` | Delete selected objects |
| `Ctrl+D` | Duplicate selected objects |

### Scene Management
